# Casino-Blackjack
Play Blackjack (21) against a dealer

The base program will have a list of cards in a deck. The program will have the "dealer" deal the hands to both the player and the 
dealer. User Input will be gathered to either "hit" or "stand". The user will play against the "dealer" in a simulated blackjack game with a pool of 500 USD.
